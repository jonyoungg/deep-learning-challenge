This project was about helping Alphabet Soup decide which groups to fund by predicting if they will succeed. I used information like the type of group, the amount of money requested, and other details. First, I removed some columns that didnâ€™t help with the prediction. Then, I changed the remaining information into a format the computer could understand.

I built a model with different layers to help the computer learn and make predictions. The model was able to predict which groups might succeed most of the time, but I still want to make it even better with some more adjustments.
